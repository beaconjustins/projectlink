        <h1>About Sakha Republic</h1>
        <p>Nestled within the Russian far east, Sakha is a land of natural beauty and extreme climate. With it's remarkably low population density and unique local culture, Sakha is the perfect place for someone looking to get away from life while still experiencing something new.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>The Sakha Republic is a subdivision of Russia in the far east region, located north of Mongolia and China, and it is also the world's largest country subdivision. Most of the land is widespread taiga, interspersed with winding rivers and countless lakes left behind from the last ice age. Where there isn't taiga there are rugged mountains stretching up to 9852 feet at the high point, Peak Pobeda. Sakha also has a well-deserved reputation for an extreme climate. Winters are long and cold, lasting most of the year with average temperatures of -30°C (-22°F) and a record low temperature of −67.8°C (−90°F). Summers are short, but surprisingly hot, with average temperatures of 21°C (71°F) a record high temperature of 38°C (101°F).</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Cities and Towns</h2>
    <p>Sakha has only one city, Yakutsk, with every other settlement being a town. If one wants a break from the scenic landscape of Sakha, then Yakutsk is the ideal location, offering a conventional city experience deep within the arctic taiga.</p>

    <br>    
    <h2>Natural Landmarks</h2>
    <p>Sakha has many natural landmarks, with most of what to offer being undocumented due to the sparse population, encouraging one to explore on their own. Some of the known landmarks include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Explore the Ulakhan-Sis Range and see the kigilyakh of northern Sakha, unique mountain formations like nowhere else.</li>
        <li>• Check out Lake Buluus, one of countless lakes in Sakha, for activies like fishing, boating and hiking.</li>
        <li>• Visit Moma National Park for beautiful mountain vistas and scenic views.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>    
    <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Being a republic of Russia, Sakha is home to a unique ethnic group, the titular Sakha people. There are also substantial minorities of Russians, Evenkns, Evens and many others. The Sakha are a turkic ethnic group, meaning they are related to the Turkish, and are unrelated to Russians, granting visitors an experience highly unlike the rest of Russia. For a cultural experience, visit locations such as:
            <ul>
                <li>• Yakutsk Regional History Museum, where one can see relics dating all the way back to prehistoric times.</li>
                <li>• Prospekt Lenina, the main street of Yakutsk, where one can find the heart of Sakha urban culture.</li>
                <li>• Gradoyakutskiy Transfiguration Cathedral, the oldest church in Sakha, from 1826.</li>
                <li>• Archy House, where one can get a cultural tour and overview of Sakha culture, and try some traditional foods and beverages.</li>
                <li>• Krestyanskiy Market, a street market that offers a much more genuine view of the local culture, unobsctructed by tourism and accessibility.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
